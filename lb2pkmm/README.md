# Scripts to examine whether this method works for Lb->pKmm decays
These files tend to be to large for browsers, so should be run in mathematica locally. The notebook `SupplMat_Moments_simplified.nb` modifies the moments given in the supplementary material of arxiv:2210.09988 and is here for reference. The notebook `K1-K18.nb` contains the 18 relevant moments in the known format. You don't need to open this directly either. Instead look at the notebook `example-script.nb`. It shows how to read in the moments from the file and gives a few examples of possibly convenient simplifications.
